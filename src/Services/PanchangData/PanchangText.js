        A Panchang, also known as Panchanga or Hindu Calendar, is a traditional
        Hindu astrological almanac that provides comprehensive information about
        various aspects of time and celestial events. The word “Panchang” is
        derived from the Sanskrit words “Pancha,” meaning five, and “Anga,”
        meaning limb or part. Therefore, Panchang refers to the five elements of
        time.
